# FridgePal
#### What's good eatin?

This is my first Flutter application. I wanted to use it as a small stepping
stone to learning more cross-platform mobile development. The idea of
'everything' being a Widget is hard to grasp at first, but I found it
pretty easy to implement documentation for building most of the common mobile
dev assets.

The function is simple, keep track of groceries in a fridge. You add a
new fridge item with the button at the bottom, and it appears in the
main list.

My goals with this project are:
- learn Flutter basic widgets and architecture
- implement animations and thawed-out design
- test implementations on iOS, Android, and Chrome application

This app is still in development, please forgive any sloppy code
